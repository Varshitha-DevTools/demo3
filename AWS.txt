Definition of cloud computing: CC is the on demand delivery of compute ,database storage, apps & other IT resources(Data storage, VMs, Networks, servers).


Cloud services - ec2, s3, lambda,

Compute - ec2 IAM
Storage - s3
Data out - database
Networking - 

=================To Recognize================
ROOT user - Root user id
IAM user - username

2002 int launched
2003 amazon infra
2006 sqs
2007 ec2, sqs, s3 bucket

AZs are selected based on:
cost 
some services are not present in all AZs

In cloud - customers
of the cloud - Cloud service provider

IAM (Identity & Access Management) is a web a service that helps you to securely control access to AWS resources.
""IAM contains"" 
1. Root user - user admin (no restrictions)
2. IAM user - user with restrictions
3. Groups - groups contain only users , these users can be in 1 or many groups.

""IAM permissions:""
user & groups can be assigned Json documents called policies
IAM policies will be in json format
A user must be assigned with least permission at first 

Json-doc format Structure
"Version": "--"
"Statement":[
     {	
	"Effect": "Allow",
	"Action": "ec2:Describe*",
	"Resource": "*"
     }
]

"""""""""""""How to mention to specific user we use principal"""""""""""""""
"Principal": {
	"AWS":["arn:aws:iam:::123456789012:root"]	
}

Authorization: To which we are responsible
Authentication: In what way we are signing / logging in

MFA- Multi Factor Authentication.

""""""""AWS can be accessed through"""""""""
1. AWS console (password and MFAs)
2. AS CLI (access keys , access keys are generated in console)
	Access key consists - Access key id(username), Secrete access key(password)
3. AWS SDK (code perspective, used by developers, language "Java,python" specific, programmatically how to access services)

'''''''''AWS CLI'''''''''
Its a where we interact with AWS through commands


'''''''''IAM roles for services'''''''''
EC2
lambda functions 

'''''''''''IAM Security Tools'''''''''
1. IAM Credentials reports(Accounts level) 
	- gives all user accounts of a group details like passwords when logged in etc.
2. IAM Access advisor(User level) 
	- gives details about each user separately.

''''''''''''''''Best practices of IAM:''''''''''
Don't use root user always to access AWS, services except during account creation.
MFA
Roles creation and assigning permissions
IAM Security Tools

aws --version
aws configure


--------------------------------------------------------------------EC2----------------------------------------------------------

EC2
considered as VM let it make as a server.



''''''Activity ''''''
Connect two EC2 instances and verify in AWS itself



''''''Activity done''''''
In EBS recycle bin concept
In EBS archive concept
Connect 1 EC2 to a EBS
